# THE CORTEX CHRONICLES, CHAPTER 5 - The Simulations of Ignatius Cogwell

Developed for the Global Game Jam'24 at Lusofona University.
This year the theme was "Make Me Laugh".

Since this is also to be used for the Game Creator Club this month, I'm trying to marry this with the existing games I've been making this year.

This is a part of what I hope will be "The Cortex Chronicles" - I want all the games I do for the Game Creator's Club this year to be linked together, hence this idea.
I also want to use a different engine on every entry, so let's see how that goes! :)

This time, I'm using Unity, since I don't want to struggle with the engine, and I haven't done Unity yet.

## Game

In this puzzle game, we're thrust into a series of simulations designed by Doctor Ignatius Cogwell, a scientist working for Cortex and the Prime Nexus.

He's working on the mood altering drug MoodMorph, which can change the mood of people, making them plyable and he's running a series of simulations to
understand the limits of the drug, and what can be achieved through it.

The player can take control of a series of simulated characters called emotisims and by interacting with other emotisims he can reach the goals given for
each level.
