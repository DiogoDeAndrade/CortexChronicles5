# THE CORTEX CHRONICLES, CHAPTER 5 - TBD

Developed for the Global Game Jam'24 at Lusofona University.
This year the theme was "Make Me Laugh".

Since this is also to be used for the Game Creator Club this month, I'm trying to marry this with the existing games I've been making this year.

This is a part of what I hope will be "The Cortex Chronicles" - I want all the games I do for the Game Creator's Club this year to be linked together, hence this idea.
I also want to use a different engine on every entry, so let's see how that goes! :)

This time, I'm using Unity, since I don't want to struggle with the engine, and I haven't done Unity yet.
